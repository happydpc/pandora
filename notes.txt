Voxelization:
No library that guarantees watertight results + most Github projects are CLI ==> have to write my own
Going to be based on: http://research.michael-schwarz.com/publ/files/vox-siga10.pdf because its conservative, modern and fast (well parallelizable)

Paper uses xy, xz and yz planes. They do not mention that for the xz plane the edge normal flip with respect to the 3D normal is reversed (flip if y >= 0.0f).
Alternatively they could have used teh zx plane in which the flip matches that of xy and yz.

Optimization 1:
Splitting the code into a preprocess and intersect function (like in the paper) is a bad idea. More time is spent on memory allocation than on intersecting (for the Stanford Dragon).

Optimization 2:
